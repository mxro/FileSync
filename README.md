FileSync
========

A Desktop App for Synchronizing Files with Appjangle Data

## Planned Features

- Keep a map with file hashes mapped to URIs of files they belong to. Look up this cache whenever 
a new file is inserted and use the URI of the file if a matching hash exists.

- Store value of folder nodes in children metadata.

- Add support for two files with identical names (but different extensions) in one folder.
